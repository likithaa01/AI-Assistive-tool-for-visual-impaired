## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered application that assists visually impaired individuals by leveraging Generative AI and computer vision techniques. The application provides features like real-time scene understanding, text-to-speech conversion, object and obstacle detection, and personalized assistance. The goal is to create an intuitive, accessible solution to help visually impaired users better perceive and interact with their surroundings...

## Key Features
The application offers the following functionalities:

**Real-Time Scene Understanding:** Analyzes and describes the content of an uploaded image, helping users understand the scene.

**Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Extracts text from the uploaded image using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and reads it aloud to users.

**Object and Obstacle Detection:** Detects objects and obstacles within an image, highlighting them to enhance user safety and awareness.

**Personalized Assistance for Daily Tasks:** Provides task-specific guidance by recognizing objects, reading labels, and giving context-specific information.

## Technologies Used-

**Python:** The core programming language used to implement the application and integrate all AI models.

**Langchain:** For building language-based applications, useful for connecting Generative AI models to assist with scene understanding and text conversion.

**Streamlit:** For creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the AI system, upload images, and view results.

**Google Generative AI:** To leverage advanced models for text generation, scene understanding, and text-to-speech conversion.

**Tesseract OCR:** For extracting text from images, which is then converted into speech.

**OpenCV:** For image processing, manipulation, and object detection within the images.

**YOLO (You Only Look Once):** For real-time object detection, helping to identify and highlight objects or obstacles in the images.


## Application Workflow-
**Upload an Image:** The user uploads an image via the Streamlit interface.

**Process the Image:** The application processes the image using the selected AI features.

**Scene Understanding:** Describes the image content.

**Text Extraction & Speech:** Reads any text found in the image and converts it to speech.

**Object/Obstacle Detection:** Identifies and highlights objects/obstacles for navigation.

**Results Display:** The output is displayed in a user-friendly format (text descriptions, speech output, and object highlights).
